        question:"How are the target weights of GMI determined?",
        answer:`Gloop&apos;s target rates are determined by a proprietary algorithm and will be adjusted often to constantly optimize for the ever changing market. The algorithm is fed tens of thousands of inputs including historical price data for each gm and the corresponding historical yield. After doing many calculations the algorithm outputs the optimal weighting of assets to achieve the highest expected return for a given level of risk based on cutting edge financial formulas. Building this algorithm wouldn&apos;t have been possible without the help and input of a Gloop advisor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-lee-8210a78/" target="_blank" class=" text-[#19fb80]">Peter Lee</a>, who has decades of experience managing billions of dollars on Wall Street.`

    {
        question:"How does GMI achieve target weight?",
        answer:"GMI achieves target weights by decreasing the deposit fees for assets that are below target and increasing deposit fees for assets that are above the target weight (and vice versa) the same way GLP works."
